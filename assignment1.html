        <h1> Assignment 1: Static Webpage </h1>
        <p>
        For your next assignment, you will be creating a basic static webpage
        with header, text, and image elements to get practice using html tags.
        It will also help you get practice using Vim and git. This will be the
        entryway into designing more complicated websites and working on
        software projects in other languages. 
        </p>

        <p>
        The exact assignment is to create a simple bio webpage that incorporates
        at least 3 headings, 3 paragrpahs, and 3 images of you or your work. The
        guide below should help remind you how to use these elements. The
        project should be completed in at least 3 well-documented commits to
        GitHub.
        </p>

        <h4> AS ALWAYS: </h4>
        <p>
        <b> If you do not complete this assignment you will get an incomplete

        <h3> Headings </h3>
        Headings are created by using the <code> &lt;h1> </code> to <code>
            &lt;h6>
        </code> tags. For example

        <pre> 
        &lt;h1> This is a LARGE HEADING &lt;/h1> 
        &lt;h2> This is a Large heading &lt;/h2>
        &lt;h6> this is the smallest smallest heading &lt;/h6>
        </pre>

        when evaluated becomes:

        <h1> This is a LARGE HEADING </h1>
        <h2> This is a Large heading </h2>
        <h6> this is the smallest smallest heading </h6>
        
        <hr>

        <h3> Text </h3>
        
        <p> Text is just written within the <code> &lt;body> </code> tags, but
        can be encoded in paragraphs inside <code> &lt;p> </code> tags. Bold
        text is written by the &lt;b> tag. So, for example:

        <pre>
        &lt;p> This is a paragraph &lt;/p>
        &lt;p> &lt;b> This is another paragraph &lt;/b> &lt;/p>
        </pre>

        when evaluated becomes:

        <p> This is a paragraph </p>
        <p> <b> This is another paragraph </b> </p>

        <hr>

        <h3> Images </h3>

        <p> Images are added by using the <code> &lt;img> </code> tag. The
        syntax is as follows: </p>
        
        <pre>
        &lt;img src="url" alt="some_text" height="42" width="42">
        </pre>

        <p>
        The img tag is one that takes multiple arguments. Arguments are
        independent variables that the user specifies to define the output of
        the function. For example, the <code>src</code> argument controls the
        source of the image file to display, often a url. Instead of a url, the
        <code>src</code> can also be the path to an image file that is relative to the html
        file. If the image is in the same directory as the html file, it can
        just be the filename. the <code>alt</code> argument specifies the text
        that is to be displayed if the image can't be loaded for some reason
        (for example if the filepath specified for <code>src</code> is invalid). The
        arguments <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> control
        (surprise...) the height and width of the image, but are not necessary
        if you are happy with the size of the image as-is. </p>

        So the code:
        <pre>
        &lt;img src="rainbow_kittencorn.jpg" alt="rainbow kittycorn">
       </pre>

       <p>gets rendered as:</p>
        <img src="rainbow_kittencorn.jpg" alt="rainbow kittycorn">

    </body>
</html>
