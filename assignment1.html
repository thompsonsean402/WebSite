        The Hello, World! program is usually the first one beginning
        programmers learn. It's the first thing you will do for this class.
        It may seem simple, but the Hello, World! program is actually a
        masterpiece of engineering. When you write it, it will be your first
        steps into a new and beautiful world, and you should feel proud.

        <p> <!-- open a new paragraph in a similar way -->
        After Hello, we will move on to making your own web page.
        This is a good way to get you started writing code, becoming
        comfortable using to learn the command line, learning to use version
        control, and learning to use GitHub. These lessons will be applicable
        to any programming language.

        <h2> So let's get started! </h2>

        <p>
        The Hello, World program is very simple. It is just a program that
        prints the words "Hello, World!". That's it. We will use it to
        make sure that you know how to use the text editor, can use it to
        create a simple .html document, can commit it to version control, push
        to a github repository, and create a pull request.
        </p>

        <p>
        To complete the assignment, you will need to have a text editor
        installed (Vim is preferred), Git installed and configured, have a
        GitHub profile created, and be linked to the PoP classroom in the BHHS
        organization on GitHub. If you need help setting this up on your
        computer COME SEE ME. You will not be able to complete the assignment
        without these tools.
        </p>

        <p>
        When you have done this, you will be familiar with the basic workflow
        of software development, and then we can really get coding!
