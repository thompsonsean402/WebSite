    <head> <!-- open the head definition with this tag-->
        <title> Hello, World! </title> <!-- the document title goes here -->

        <h1> Hello, World! </h1> <!-- there are 6 heading sizes... h1 - h6 -->
        
        <p> <!-- open a paragraph like this, then write your content --> 
        The Hello, World! program is usually the first one beginning
        programmers learn. It's the first thing you will do for this class.
        It may seem simple, but the Hello, World! program is actually a
        masterpiece of engineering. When you write it, it will be your first
        steps into a new and beautiful world, and you should feel proud.
        </p> <!-- then close the paragraph -->
        
        <h2> So let's get started! </h2> <!-- here is another heading -->

        <p> <!-- open a new paragraph in a similar way -->
        The Hello, World program is very simple. It is just a program that
        prints the words "Hello, World!". That's it. We will use it to
        make sure that you know how to use the text editor, can use it to
        create a simple .html document, can commit it to version control, push
        to a GitHub repository, and create a pull request.
        </p>

        <p>
        To complete the Hello assignment, you will need to have a text editor
        installed (Vim is preferred), Git installed and configured, have a
        GitHub profile created, and be linked to the PoP classroom in the BHHS
        organization on GitHub. If you need help setting this up on your
        computer COME SEE ME. You will not be able to complete the assignment
        without these tools.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> Follow the assignment link to create your own repository </li>
            <li> Open the command line program (Terminal or CMD) </li>
            <li> <code> cd workspace </code> to change directory to workspace </li> 
            <li> <code> git clone git@github.com:bhhs/pop1-username </code> to clone the assignment repository </li> 
            <li> <code> cd pop1-username </code> change to assignment
                directory </li>
            <li> <code> vim hello.html </code> to start editing a new file called
            hello.html </li>
            <li> edit the text file to implement the Hello, World! program </li>
            <li> in Normal Mode use <code> :wq </code> to save the file </li>
            <li> <code> git add hello.html </code> to stage your new file in git
            </li>
            <li> <code> git commit -m "commit message here" </code> to commit
                your changes </li> 
            <li> <code> git push origin master </code> to push your changes to
            the remote repository </li> 
        </ol>

        <p>
        When you have done this, you will be familiar with the basic workflow
        of software development, and then we can really get coding!
        </p>
        
        <p> 
        After Hello, we will move on to making your own web page.
        This is a good way to get you started writing code, becoming
        comfortable using to learn the command line, learning to use version
        control, and learning to use GitHub. These lessons will be applicable
        to any programming language.
        </p> <!-- ...and close it -->
