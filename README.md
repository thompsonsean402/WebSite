# Practice of Programming

#### Welcome to the Practice of Programming at the Blue Hill Harbor School

This course is all about learning to use the essential tools of programming. It will provide a primer in the foundational tools you need to know how to use in order to successfully manage or contribute to a high quality programming project either on your own or on a team. We will use the development of a simple static website as our project.

At the end of this course, students will:

- be able to use the command line to navigate their file system
- be able to use the text editor Vim as an Integrated Development Environment
- be able to use the version control system Git to track the changes to their program over time
- be able to use GitHub to remotely track project changes
- be able to use GitHub to access other people's projects 
- be able to create a simple webpage with text, image, and style elements using HTML and CSS
- be able to do research in appropriate locations to answer their software development questions

The course runs for 1 block, and student assessment will be based on *successful and timely* completion of 4 assignments.

1. Hello, World!
2. Basic personal web page with text and images
3. Use of CSS to further style your web page
4. Link to 2 additional pages to make a full website

Students who complete this course successfully will be in a good position to go on to learn about more complex web design and also to begin learning a more general purpose programming language such as Python.
